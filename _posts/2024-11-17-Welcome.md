# whoami

I am Alex. I'm Software Engineer by day, crazed security enthusiast by night! I've been enthusiastic about
tech since I was in junior high-school, trying to figure out why my family's internet was so slow. I've been
learning GRC, pentesting, blue teaming, reverse engineering and malware analysis it's these subjects I plan 
to write blog posts on.

I'm a cat dad, and baby dad. My wife and I rewatch the show Psych regularly. I Reddit a lot. And I have a 
big list of unfinished Udemy courses. 

Music to code to:
- Tech Thieves
- Falling in Reverse
- Jon Bellion
